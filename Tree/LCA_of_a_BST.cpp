========================================================================================================

    Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.

    According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

    

    Example 1:


    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
    Example 2:


    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
    Example 3:

    Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
    Output: 2
    

    Constraints:

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
    -109 <= Node.val <= 109
    All Node.val are unique.
    p != q
    p and q will exist in the BST.

// Definition for a binary tree node.
struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
};


/*
    Approach : 
    since this is BST the value is sorted if we traverse it in inorder traverse .
    
    if root greater than both p & q then ancestor is on the right so traverse to right
    if root less than both p & q then ancestor is on the left so traverse to left
    else this is ancestor

    from example 2 : 
    if p = 8, q = 9 ; so we will traverse to right since 6 < 8 and 6 < 9
    now root became 8 ; 8 < and 8 < 9 is not true again 8 > 8 and 8 > 9 also not true
    so the ans is 8

    Time Complexity : O(Height) since condition diye traverse hocce eijonno maximum height porjonto gelei ans pawa jay
    Space Complexity : O(1) eikhane jehetu only height porjonto traverse hocche sob node na tai call stack e O(n) hoy na tai overall space O(1)
    SO,
    TC : O(height)
    SC : O(1)
